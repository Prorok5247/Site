# 4 | Our first mixin
* * *
## Creating our Mixin class
So, Minecraft, is seperated into different folders like so

![Minecraft folder seperation](../../res/FM_DIFF_FOLDER.png)

The class we want to modify is the Minecraft class, which is located inside the `client` folder
Which means, we should make a `client` folder inside our mixins folder to house our mixin class
```
project
    -> src
        -> java
            -> GROUP_NAME
                -> mixins
                    -> client <-- Create this
```

Since we don't want to polute Minecraft's namespace, we append the word `Mixin` to our mixin classes to avoid it clashing with Minecraft class names, which means, inside the client folder we just created, create a class by the name of `MinecraftMixin`, which will act as a mixin for the `Minecraft` class
* * *
## Making the mixin
We need to tell the Mixin library what class `MinecraftMixin` is going to act as a mixin for (a class that will add in it's own code to another class).

This is trivial, as we can use a simple annotation to denote that this is a mixin for the `Minecraft` class

```java linenums="1"
@Mixin(Minecraft.class)
public class MinecraftMixin {
    ...
}
```

Now that we have told `Mixin` that we are going to modify the `Minecraft` class's methods, we can actually modify a function, but before that, we need to understand the two main ways of doing it

You can use the `@Overwrite` annotation, this will completely overwrite the code in a function, which is a **destructive change**, but it can be done like so:
```java linenums="1"
@Overwrite
private void functioNameToOverwrite(int p1, String p2) {
    ...
}
```

!!! note
    There **are** other ways to  inject into (ie: `INVOKE_ASSIGN`), but I will get into that later

However, since this is a destructive change, you may want to instead *inject* your code, which allows you to add code at either the `HEAD` of the function, which is the top of the function, or at the `RETURN` of the function, which is just before the return statement (or the end of the function), this is a bit more complex, as `Mixin` needs quite a bit more information

You need to supply

1. The method name in a string
2. Where you want to inject at
3. The method parameters for the method to inject, and a `CallbackInfo` object with provides information about the function and allow you to handle certian things like cancel the function

!!! note
    The `RETURN` can be replaced with `HEAD` if you want to inject from the start of the function

```java linenums="1"
@Inject(method = "functionNameToInject", at = @At("RETURN"))
private void functionNameToInject(int otherParameters, CallbackInfo ci) {
    ...
}
```

Now that you know the basics of mixins, we can now attempt to write our mixin

1. Method name
    The `Minecraft` class has a method that runs when the game starts, aptly named `startGame`, which is what we want to inject into

2. Where to inject
    Injecting at the `HEAD` of this function will allow our code to run before Minecraft has been initalised, and `RETURN` will allow our code to run after Minecraft has been initalised, we will go for `RETURN` for now, but you can easily switch it

We can now use the `@Inject` annotation to inject into the function `startGame`, at the location just before the function ends

For now, we can add a simple print statement to verify that this works via outputting to the console

!!! note
    Why does this function have the name `init`, when the method we want to inject into is called `startGame`?

    This is because we already tell `Mixin` that we want to inject into `startGame` with the method parameter in the annotation, so `Mixin` doesn't care what the function name is

```java linenums="1"
@Inject(method = "startGame", at = @At("RETURN"))
private void init(CallbackInfo ci) {
    System.out.println("INIT -> CLIENT STARTED!");
}
```
* * *
## Mixin still doesn't know that `MinecraftMixin` exists
Remember the file that we created in [2 | Setting up](setting_up.md), by the name of `mixins.PROJECT_NAME.json`?

Well, we need to modify that json file to tell `Mixin` that `MinecraftMixin` is a mixin that does infact, exist

So, open `mixins.PROJECT_NAME.json`
```
project
    -> src
        -> resources
            -> mixins.PROJECT_NAME.json
```

It should look like this (obviously with your own customisations for your project structure)

```json linenums="1"
{
  "required": true,
  "compatibilityLevel": "JAVA_8",
  "verbose": true,
  "package": "tech.lowspeccorgi.mixinclienttutorial.mixins",
  "refmap": "mixins.MixinClientTutorial.refmap.json",
  "mixins": []
}
```

First get the relative path, from your `mixins` package to your class, so for us it should be `client.MinecraftMixin`, add that to the mixins array in the refmap file, like so

```json linenums="1"
{
  "required": true,
  "compatibilityLevel": "JAVA_8",
  "verbose": true,
  "package": "tech.lowspeccorgi.mixinclienttutorial.mixins",
  "refmap": "mixins.MixinClientTutorial.refmap.json",
  "mixins": [
      "client.MinecraftMixin"
  ]
}
```

## ðŸ¥³ You should now be able to see the output in the console
