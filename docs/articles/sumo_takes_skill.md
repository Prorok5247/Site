# Sumo takes skill
* * *

!!! warning
    Due to the fact that I only have 1.2K sumo wins on Hypixel (2K if you include practice servers), and a lackluster WLR (2.22), I may be downright wrong, or speaking from a naÃ¯ve view from a bad player

## Introduction
So, there's a rabid sentiment essentially claiming
> Sumo does not take skill.

However, while I can see why you may think this, I disagree, so I guess I shall state why in this article

## Concept
So, sumo is a gamemode involving the following

1. Hit each other
2. Wait 'til the other guy falls off

Sounds simple? Right...?

## Skill layers
### W-Tapping
Every Minecraft PvP'er worth their salt should definitely know how to W-Tap, release the ++w++ key when your hit gets registered, to deal more knockback, then just holding the ++w++ key

The skill ceiling to W-Tapping increases considering that due to the fact sumo is a very 'tight' gamemode, very small advantages are valued, so constantly adjusting your timings for W-Tapping and even switching to S-Tapping on occasion can give a signifigant advantage in terms of sumo

### Strafing
Switch between moving to the right and left with your ++a++ and ++d++ keys occasionally

Basic, right...?

It's a basic skill, but, for it to do much you need to constantly switch between doing things like circle strafing, to ++a+d++ tapping, and then even just straightlining on occasion

Why do this?

Aside from the obvious advantages, it really helps throw off the opponent's aim (especially if you have bad aim like me), and punishes people not paying full attentio
